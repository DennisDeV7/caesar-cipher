# Lab - Class 18

## Project: Caesar Cipher

## Author: Dennis DeVries

## Setup

With virtual environment activated and requirements downloaded:

run tests: `pytest-watch -c -- -k test_caesar.py`

I did not yet complete test crack nonesense and test_crack_phrase because the capital letter in the beginning of the phrase is not restarting at A.
